### Start
Millenial Falco: Ugh!!!

Millenial Falco: I'm so sick of carrying around all these damn letters!

Stranger: Hello there!

Millenial Falco: Grandfather Swanobi?!

Grandfather Swanobi: Young Falco! Your mother Stella is dead, but this is no time for grief! You must deliver this letter to the top of the Old Tree!

Millenial Falco: MOM IS DEAD?!

Grandfather Swanobi: Hurry now! The EMUPIRE is coming! You must reach the top in three minutes!

Millenial Falco: You want me to try to climb the Old Tree in 3 minutes?

Grandfather Swanobi: Do or do not, attempting is not a valid option!

### Letter 1 

Letter: 
  
Dear Father,
  
I know I haven't written in a long time. We both miss you and hope you're doing well.

There's something you need to know. Mom is getting ill. Very ill. And I'm not sure if she going to be all right on her own.

Is it possible for you to get on a shuttle home soon?

Miss you,
Falco

### Letter 2
Letter:

Dear Father,

I know you must have a reason for not responding to my last letter. Mom is getting worse. The doctor says that it's Tuskus Radia, a "viral auto-immune disease". 

I don't know what that means, but I know that it does not seem good. 

Mom always said you were nothing but a scruffy nerf herder, please don't prove her right.

### Letter 3
Letter:

Dear Father,

Mother is dying.

The disease has taken her wings, her legs, and her left lung.
Life support wont keep her here forever.

Mother told me to find you, but she needs me here now while she's so weak, so I don't dare leave her for long.

Don't make me do this alone dad, you're our only hope.

Falco
